Welcome to my fractol !

NAME
	fractol -- Show a set of fractal selected by the user

SYNOPSIS
	fractol [[OPTIONS]... [FRACTAL]]...

DESCRIPTION
	This program allow you to simply discover the beautiful world of fractals.
	To use, just launch the program with the fractal you want to see.

	You can put parameters before the fractal name to change the program
	behaviour.

	You can also open multiple fractals in one time. The following example
	will open 2 fractals:
		./fractal julia mandelbrot
	The following example will open multiples fractals with different
	parameters:
		./fractal -wh 100 -it 42 julia mandelbrot -zoom 2 douady

FRACTALS
	julia
	mandelbrot
	douady

OPTIONS
	-wh		Set window height for the next fractal.
			Take a int as parameter. Must be superior to 0.

	-ww		Set window width for the next fractal.
			Take a int as parameter. Must be superior to 0.

	-it		Set base iteration for the next fractal.
			Take a int as parameter. Must be superior or equal to 0.

	-zoom		Set base zoom the the next fractal.
			Take a int as parameter. Must be superior to 0.

	-xoff		Set base horizontal offset for the next fractal.
			Take a int as parameter.

	-yoff		Set base vertical offset for the next fractal.
			Take a int as parameter.

	-m_lock		Lock the julia parameter at the start of the program.

	-help		Show this help.
